## 🌱 Beyond the Code

Technology is what I do, but it's not all I am. In 2025, I learned that health and family must come first:

### Health & Wellness
Taking control of my health through sustainable lifestyle changes—intermittent fasting, HIIT workouts, and mindful eating. Because the best code in the world means nothing if we're not here to enjoy life.

### Family Time
Dedicated to creating memories with my loved ones through travel, adventures, and simply being present. Quality time isn't about grand gestures—it's about consistent, intentional presence.

### Continuous Learning
Especially passionate about AI technologies and their impact on software development. Finding the balance between AI-enhanced productivity and maintaining code craftsmanship is an exciting challenge.

## 💭 My Philosophy

> **Quality Over Speed**: AI enables us to move faster than ever, but speed without quality is recklessness.

> **Team Success**: Individual brilliance is fleeting; team success is lasting.

> **Growth Mindset**: Technology evolves, and so should we. Stay curious, stay humble, stay learning.

> **Health Foundation**: Without health, nothing else matters. Invest in yourself first.

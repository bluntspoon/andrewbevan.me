# Hi, I'm Andrew 👋

I'm a Senior Developer from [Durban, South Africa](https://goo.gl/maps/rQsiecctb9SovcdG9) 🔴🔵🟡🟢, and I've spent the last 18+ years building software that powers some of the world's largest iGaming platforms at [Derivco](https://www.derivco.com).

But before we talk about code, let me tell you what really matters to me: **family, health, and continuous growth**.

## My Journey 🚀

### The Professional Path

I started my career with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology from Durban University of Technology. What began as curiosity about how software works has evolved into a passion for solving complex problems, architecting scalable systems, and mentoring teams through technological transformation.

At Derivco, I've had the privilege of working on projects that reach millions of users:
- **Cloud-native game management systems** that streamline delivery across multiple platforms
- **Cross-platform poker experiences** running seamlessly on web, Android, Windows, and Mac
- **Architectural transformations** leveraging Kubernetes, Terraform, and modern cloud technologies

### The Personal Side

2025 was a transformative year for me. Health challenges—hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity—became my wake-up call. These weren't just medical diagnoses; they were reminders that our health is the foundation for everything else. No career achievement matters if we're not here to enjoy it with the people we love.

Now, I'm committed to:
- **Sustainable health habits**: intermittent fasting, HIIT workouts, mindful eating
- **Quality family time**: creating memories, traveling together, being truly present
- **Continuous learning**: especially in AI technologies that are reshaping our industry

## What I Bring to the Table 💻

**Technical Expertise:**
- **Languages & Frameworks**: C# / .NET / TypeScript / JavaScript / HTML5 / CSS3
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Azure (AKS, Kubernetes, Terraform), CI/CD pipelines
- **Databases**: SQL Server, EF Core, Dapper, LINQ
- **Tools**: Visual Studio, VS Code, Azure DevOps, GitHub

**But more importantly:**
- **Problem-solving mindset**: I love tackling complex challenges and finding elegant solutions
- **Team collaboration**: 18+ years of working with diverse, multicultural teams
- **Adaptability**: Navigating organizational change and emerging technologies (especially AI)
- **Quality focus**: Balancing speed with craftsmanship—AI enables us to move fast, but quality is non-negotiable

## Professional Credentials 🎓

- Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals
- Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer: Web Applications and App Builder
- Microsoft Certified Professional Developer: Web Developer
- Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist: .NET Framework
- Applied Project Management in Information Technology, UNISA

## My Values 💡

**Health First**: Without health, nothing else matters. I'm on a journey to better myself physically and mentally.

**Family Always**: My family is my why. Every career decision, every project, every late night—it's all to build a better future for them.

**Continuous Growth**: Technology never stops evolving, and neither should we. I'm committed to learning, especially in AI and cloud architecture.

**Quality Over Speed**: AI is transforming how we work, but speed without quality is recklessness. Finding that balance is my ongoing challenge.

**Team Success**: Individual brilliance is fleeting; team success is lasting. I believe in lifting others up and growing together.

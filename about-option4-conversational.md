# Hey there! 👋

I'm Andrew Bevan, and I've been writing code for nearly two decades. But before we dive into the technical stuff, let me answer the questions people usually ask:

## Who are you?

I'm a Senior Developer from Durban, South Africa 🔴🔵🟡🟢, currently working at [Derivco](https://www.derivco.com) where I've spent 18+ years of my career. I specialize in building scalable cloud-native applications, but more importantly, I love solving complex problems and helping teams grow.

Outside of work? I'm a husband, a father, and someone who recently learned (the hard way) that health comes first.

## What do you do?

**The Short Answer**: I build software that powers online gaming platforms used by millions of people worldwide.

**The Longer Answer**: I'm a solution architect and senior developer focusing on:
- Designing and implementing cloud-native systems on Azure
- Building microservices architectures with Kubernetes and .NET
- Mentoring developers and shaping technical strategy
- Integrating AI tools into development workflows (while maintaining quality!)

**Recent Projects**:
- Cloud-based game management platform serving multiple markets
- Cross-platform multiplayer poker system (web, mobile, desktop)
- Infrastructure-as-Code implementations with Terraform
- CI/CD pipeline transformations

## What's your tech stack?

Glad you asked! Here's what I work with daily:

**Languages**: C# (my bread and butter), TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL  
**Frameworks**: .NET Core, ASP.NET, React basics  
**Cloud**: Azure (AKS, App Services, Functions), Kubernetes, Docker  
**DevOps**: Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, Terraform  
**Databases**: SQL Server, Azure SQL, CosmosDB, EF Core  
**Tools**: Visual Studio, VS Code, Git, Azure Data Studio

## What certifications do you have?

**Microsoft Certifications:**
- Azure Administrator Associate
- Azure Fundamentals
- Solutions Developer: Web Applications
- Professional Developer: Web Developer
- Technology Specialist: .NET Framework

**Education:**
- Bachelor's in Information Technology (Durban University of Technology)
- Project Management in IT (UNISA)
- AI and Big Data courses

## How do you approach development?

I believe in:

**Quality > Speed** - AI lets us move fast, but rushed code creates technical debt. Finding the balance is key.

**Team Success** - Individual brilliance fades; team success endures. I'd rather build something great together than something good alone.

**Continuous Learning** - Technology evolves constantly. Stay curious, stay humble, keep learning.

**Pragmatic Solutions** - Not every problem needs the latest framework. Sometimes simple is better.

## What's your work style?

- **Collaborative**: I love pair programming and technical discussions
- **Communicative**: Clear communication saves countless hours of confusion
- **Mentorship-focused**: Teaching others helps me solidify my own understanding
- **Quality-conscious**: Write code you'd be proud to maintain in 3 years
- **Adaptable**: Requirements change, technologies evolve—flexibility is essential

## What are you learning right now?

In 2026, I'm focused on:
- **AI-Enhanced Development**: How to leverage tools like GitHub Copilot without sacrificing code quality
- **Advanced Kubernetes**: Service mesh patterns, advanced deployment strategies
- **Health & Productivity**: Sustainable development practices (turns out burnout is real!)
- **Leadership Skills**: Technical excellence is just one part of senior roles

## What's important to you?

**2025 taught me some hard lessons.** Health challenges—high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity—were my wake-up call. No career achievement matters if you're not healthy enough to enjoy life.

So now my priorities are:
1. **Health**: Sustainable lifestyle changes (intermittent fasting, HIIT workouts, mindful eating)
2. **Family**: Quality time with loved ones, creating memories, being present
3. **Career Growth**: Continuous learning, but at a sustainable pace
4. **Giving Back**: Mentoring, knowledge sharing, helping others grow

## Want to chat?

I'm always up for interesting conversations about:
- Software architecture decisions (the good, the bad, the "what were we thinking?")
- Cloud native development patterns
- AI's impact on how we write code
- Balancing career ambition with personal wellbeing
- The iGaming industry's unique technical challenges
